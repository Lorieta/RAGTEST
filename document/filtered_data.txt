    "message": "Oh Ok, I'm not too familiar with her work, I'll have to look it up after the chat. I do follow a couple of sports authors and read an opinion piece on why the author thinks the University of Iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is painted pink.",

    "message": "I know a lot of facts about NFL and I watch the superbowl, but other than that, I'm lost for words as to why people like football. How can a game with 11 minutes of live gameplay take 3 hours of air time.",
    "agent": "agent_1"
  },
  {
    "message": "Haha, I feel the same way! It's because they need to play ads so as to beat the average lifetime earnings of engineers because supposedly their earnings are higher than the average lifetime earnings of NFL players which I find hard to believe.",

    "message": "Yeah, I should've done that too and if my kids ever wanted to be professional cheerleaders, I would be very opposed to it especially since the Saints cheerleaders are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant as the NFL players. They're humans too!",
    "agent": "agent_2"
  },
  {
    "message": "That sounds like borderline discrimination but I guess they don't want the cheerleaders to influence the game. They must have had previous encounters of bad press.",

  },
  {
    "message": "Good point, but there's something wrong with that rule. Yeah, but even if females can play, I'd imagine some would have a difficult time meeting the leagues physical eligibility requirements, I'm not sure what that is, do you know?",

  {
    "message": "I wonder if that's their attempt to bring statistics into the game, similar to how baseball is all a statistical game. Sounds like some 1950 harvard mathematic research team with the latest gadgets.",
    "agent": "agent_1"
  },
  {
    "message": "Haha, that would be cool to track, like how fast a quarterback can throw a ball or the force at which someone tackles. I wonder if the player's contracts for salary are adjusted because they're either one of the fastest players or something.",
    "agent": "agent_2"
  },
  {
    "message": "I doubt the franchise would even know what to do with this data. A lot of them are retired football players who just knows the old fashion game play and will probably never adopt new technology.",
